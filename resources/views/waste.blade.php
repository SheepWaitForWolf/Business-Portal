		<p> East Dunbartonshire Council will collect waste and recycling seven days a week, rather than just Monday to Friday. You should also be aware that your food waste may now be collected on a different day from your recycling or general waste.

The Council collects household waste in the following bins:

Grey food caddy (collected weekly)	All food waste, cooked or raw, including bones and shells.  Please do not put liquids in this bin.
Blue bin (collected fortnightly)	Paper, newspapers, cardboard, junk mail, magazines, catalogues, telephone directories.  Please make sure paper and card is clean and dry.
Brown bin (collected fortnightly)	Glass jars and bottles, aerosol cans, food and drink cans, household plastic bottles (e.g. milk and juice containers, cleaning product bottles, shampoo and toiletry bottles).  Please wash and squash your bottles so they take up less space.
Grey bin (collected fortnightly)	All other household waste (rubbish) that cannot be recycled. View our list of Frequently Asked Questions.
Green bin (collected fortnightly March to November)	Garden waste e.g. flowers, plants, grass cuttings, hedge clippings, leaves, shrub pruning, weeds (not invasive plants like Japanese Knotweed), small amounts of shredded paper, twigs, small branches, sawdust and wood shavings, straw or animal bedding.  Please do not put soil, turf or rubble, food waste, animal faeces, large branches, garden furniture, broken garden ornaments and general waste in this bin.
