Cross contamination prevention

The Food Standards Agency has produced guidance on preventing cross contamination. The guidance states that the safest and most reliable way to prevent cross contamination from raw foods to ready-to-eat food is by introducing complete physical separation. This would mean having completely separate equipment, food preparation areas and storage.

The Council has produced a booklet based on the text of the Food Standards Agencyâ€™s CookSafe manual to inform Food Business Operators (FBOs) of the ways in which they can help to keep their customers free from food poisoning. It also explains changes to the way in which food hygiene inspections will be carried out and how the current law will be enforced.  This is available from the document section. </p>
