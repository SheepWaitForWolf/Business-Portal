This facility may be granted to enable works on or adjacent to the road to be carried out in safety or for a charitable or community event to take place on the road. Temporary orders will not be permitted in order to allow contractors the use of the road for the purposes of site compounds.</p>


<h3>Temporary Restriction durations and fees:</h3>

Applicants are advised to take account of the time required to agree, organise and implement diversion schemes where these are necessary.</p>
